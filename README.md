# Web 3 Revenue Primitives

<img src='imgs/coins.png'>

*Core primitives* are a set of concepts that are innately understood but cannot be expressed in simpler terms.

This repository is an attempt at list of *web3 revenue primitives*, created by, for, and at [ETHMagicians Prague 2018 by the business models ring](https://hackmd.io/DaJhrasLQteUk3IwX5bQAg?view#8-Business-Models-Ring). 

[Notes from Business Models Ring at Eth Magicians, the first session which convened on 2018/10/29, are here](https://hackmd.io/W11KX6Y9R3idXXhN2tHFzA).

## Marketplace Percentage Fee

This model is where you take a % of each trsanction on your platform.  It is popular with exchanges.

## ICOS

Sell a bunch of ERC20 tokens at once, or during a window of time.

Some popular ICO models:

* [Security Token Offerings](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/security-tokens/)
* [Interactive ICO](https://medium.com/legal-block/interactive-coin-offering-a-token-distribution-alternative-model-or-the-new-face-of-the-ipos-61eee71e75ef)

## Continous Funding Models

Sell a bunch of ERC20 tokens *over time*.

* [Continuous Organizations](https://medium.com/@thibauld/introducing-continuous-organizations-22ad9d1f63b7?_branch_match_id=578515516036471346)
* [Curved Bonding](https://medium.com/@simondlr/tokens-2-0-curved-token-bonding-in-curation-markets-1764a2e0bee5)

## Streaming Money

### Side Channels:
A sidechain is a separate blockchain that is attached to its parent blockchain(mainchain) using a two-way peg. You can move assets to the sidechain and then back to the parent chain.
Sidechains need their own miners. These miners can be incentivized through ‘merged mining’, whereby two separate cryptocurrencies, based on the same algorithm, are mined simultaneously.
Here is a list of some of the Sidechain Projects:

* [Plasma](http://plasma.io/)
* [Loom](https://loomx.io/)
* [POA](https://poa.network/)
* [Truebit](https://truebit.io/)
 
### State Channels:
State channels are basically two-way pathways opened between two users that want to communicate with each other in the form of transactions. Here, only the final outcome needs to be included in the form of one single transaction on main chain. Other transaction's are done on off chain. Few know projects around it are:

* [Raiden Network](https://raiden.network/)
* [Machinomy](https://machinomy.com/)
* [FunFair](https://funfair.io/)
* [Liquidity](https://liquidity.network/)
* [Trinity](https://trinity.tech/#/)
* [Celer](https://www.celer.network/)
* [Spankchain](https://spankchain.com/)
* [Connext](https://connext.network/)
* [Counterfactual](https://counterfactual.com/)

## Non Fungible Tokens

Non fungible tokens are tokens that are unique from one another

Famous NFT projects:

* [CryptoKitties](https://medium.com/@codetractio/a-look-into-cryptokitties-revenue-model-6466b705a998)
* [OpenSea NFT marketplace](http://opensea.io)

## Subscriptions

Subscriptions are a recurring exchange of value over time.

* [EIP 1337](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1337)
* [1337 Alliance](https://1337alliance.com)

## Self-Sovereign Identity

Identity Standards Proposals:
* [EIP 725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725)
* [EIP 725 Alliance](https://erc725alliance.org/)
* [EIP 1056](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1056) and [ERC 780](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/780)
* [Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/)
* [Decentralized Identifiers (DID)](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/)

Projects in the Identity space:
* [uPort](https://uport.me)
* [Civic](https://www.civic.com/)
* [BloomID](https://bloom.co/identity/)
* [TENZ-ID](https://tenzorum.org/tenz_id/)
* [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains)

## Lending

Smart contracts that control credit scores, loan issuance, and interest payments will run on top of protocols like Ethereum. These debt contracts will be hashed into existence and generate hashflow for the lenders. This is a flow of hashflow above the base layer protocol.

* [Dharma Protocol](https://dharma.io/)
* [LoanScan](https://loanscan.io/)

## Curating

The job of a search engine like Google is to collect and curate data from the Internet. This is one of the most valuable curation projects in the world. The key with curation markets is to get all of the incentives aligned so that you can trust the underlying data. The term used in the industry is the Token Curated Registry. 
It’s not just about creating a list. It’s about creating a list you can trust by incentivising curators to do the research for you.

* [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com/)
* [Messari](https://messari.io/)

## Creating

The creation of new things on chains will have value. Selling them to people who want them will generate hashflow. Making these unique tokens takes a lot of effort. You have to get a community of people to agree to their value.

## Funding

Funding is the same whether it is at the ecosystem level or at the level of a single entity wanting to support funding. Grants are the main source of funding for projects in the Ethereum Community. Grants give a short time horizon for projects and don’t take into consideration the setup costs. Once a project has been set up, maintenance requires longer-term funding than grants provided. In many cases for an individual or small team, a business model of services can be considered on a project to project basis to find long term support. Operational costs hit projects with real-world budget and cash flow problems, and decentralized projects excel when they gather together for support. 

There is no one entity in charge of Ethereum, so the community must look at different funding bodies and revenue streams. For decentralized projects, it is a good idea to have different funding for different aspects of the ecosystem, such as stack, research, or community.  Obtaining multiple entities to fund a project is part of the shared ecosystem of Ethereum. Multiple entities of funding stop the community from defunding project Y, and instead disperse funding to both project X and Y. To get funding and sustainability of a project, it is best to collaborate with others who want to support the infrastructure, rather than waste time on putting together grant systems.
